# What is Unit Testing?

- **Unit testing** is a software development practice where **individual units** or **components** of a software application are tested in **isolation** from the rest of the application to ensure that they work as expected.

- In simple terms, **unit testing** involves writing ***automated tests*** that check whether the *smallest pieces of code*, called **"units"**, behave correctly. These units can be ***functions***, ***methods***, or ***classes*** that perform specific tasks. By testing each unit in **isolation**, developers can detect and fix errors early in the development process, before they become more difficult and expensive to fix.

- Unit testing also helps ensure that changes made to the code do not break existing functionality, and allows developers to make changes with confidence knowing that the tests will catch any potential issues.

# What is JUnit?

- **JUnit** is a widely used open-source unit testing framework for Java programming language. It provides a simple and easy-to-use framework for writing and executing automated tests for Java applications. JUnit is widely used in the software industry and is considered the de facto standard for unit testing in Java.

- With JUnit, developers can write test cases that check whether individual units of code, such as classes, methods, or functions, work as expected. JUnit provides a set of annotations, assertions, and test runners that make it easy to write and execute unit tests.

- JUnit tests are typically written using a test-driven development (TDD) approach, where tests are written before the actual code. This approach helps ensure that the code meets the desired requirements and that any changes made to the code do not break existing functionality.

- Overall, JUnit helps developers write better code, catch errors early in the development process, and improve the overall quality of Java applications.
