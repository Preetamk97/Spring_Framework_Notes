Within the **Spring Framework**, there are a variety of different **Spring modules** â€” **JDBC**, **AOP**, **Beans** etc. All Spring **Modules** share the same release version as the **Spring Framework**. They are part of the same **Spring Framework project**.

Apart from the Spring Framework and its various modules, there are other **frameworks** (under the umbrella of ***Spring***) called **Spring Projects**. These projects provide solutions to other issues faced by enterprise applications.

These projects are versioned differently from the Spring Framework. For example, the current version of the **Spring Framework** is **5.x.x** and that of **Spring Boot** (one of the Spring Projects) is **2.x.x**.

Here is a comprehensive list of Spring modules and projects along with their roles:

## Spring Modules:

- **Spring Core**: Provides the fundamental functionality of the Spring Framework, including dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC) features.
- **Spring AOP**: Provides support for aspect-oriented programming (AOP), which allows developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns in their applications.
- **Spring Context**: Builds on the core container to provide additional functionality, including support for internationalization, resource loading, and event handling.
- **Spring Expression Language (SpEL)**: A powerful expression language that allows developers to specify complex expressions in their applications.
- **Spring JDBC**: Provides support for JDBC-based database access and transaction management.
- **Spring ORM**: Provides integration with various object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks, including Hibernate, JPA, and MyBatis.
- **Spring Transactions**: Provides support for declarative transaction management for various data access technologies, including JDBC, JPA, and Hibernate.
- **Spring Web**: Provides support for web-related features, including the Spring MVC framework, WebSocket support, and asynchronous request processing.
- **Spring WebFlux**: Provides support for reactive programming and non-blocking I/O.
- **Spring Web** Services: Provides a framework for building SOAP-based web services.
