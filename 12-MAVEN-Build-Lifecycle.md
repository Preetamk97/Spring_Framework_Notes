1.  The Maven build lifecycle is a a predefined build lifecycle for executing various phases/steps of the project building process. 
1.  The Maven build lifecycle consists of three main phases: the default lifecycle, the clean lifecycle, and the site lifecycle. Each phase consists of several predefined goals that are executed in a specific order to build and package the project.
1. **Default Lifecycle**:
The default lifecycle is the primary build lifecycle that Maven uses to build the project. It consists of the following phases:

    - **validate**: This phase validates the project structure and configuration, ensuring that it is valid and can be built.
    - **compile**: This phase compiles the project's source code and creates the binary classes.
    - **test**: This phase runs the unit tests for the project to verify that the code functions as expected.
    - **package**: This phase packages the compiled code into a distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR file.
    - **verify**: This phase performs additional checks on the packaged code, such as running integration tests.
    - **install**: This phase installs the packaged code into the local repository for use by other projects.
    - **deploy**: This phase deploys the packaged code to a remote repository or a web server.
1. **Clean Lifecycle**:
The clean lifecycle is used to remove all generated files and artifacts from previous builds. It consists of a single phase:

    - **clean**: This phase removes all files generated by the previous build, such as compiled classes and packaged artifacts.
1. **Site Lifecycle**:
The site lifecycle is used to generate the project's documentation, such as user manuals and technical documentation. It consists of the following phases:

    - **site**: This phase generates the project's documentation.
    site-deploy: This phase deploys the generated documentation to a remote web server.

1. By default, Maven executes all phases of the default lifecycle in order, from validate to deploy. However, developers can customize the build process by specifying which phases to execute or by defining new goals and phases. Additionally, Maven supports profiles, which allow developers to define different build configurations for different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
